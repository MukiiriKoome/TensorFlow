# **Keras API Learning Projects** 🚀

Welcome to my **Keras API Learning Projects** repository! This repository contains all the projects, experiments, and code snippets I’ve created while learning and exploring the **Keras API** for **TensorFlow**. It serves as a record of my progress and a showcase of the skills I’ve acquired in deep learning and neural networks.

## **About Keras API**

**Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of **TensorFlow**. It provides a user-friendly and modular interface for building and training deep learning models. Keras is widely used for tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and more.
